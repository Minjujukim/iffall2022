                    Son Heung-min was born in Chuncheon, Gangwon on July 8th, 1992. His father, Son Woong-jung, is a
                    retired
                    footballer turned manager who once played for the South Korea national B team.

                    Son came through the academy at FC Seoul, the same club that former Spurs defender Lee Young-pyo
                    played
                    for.] Son was a ball boy in an FC Seoul home match in 2008 when he was a FC Seoul youth player.[21]
                    At
                    that time, his role model was midfielder Lee Chung-yong, who played for Crystal Palace and Bolton
                    Wanderers. Apart from his native language Korean, Son is also fluent in German and English. His
                    agent
                    Thies Bliemeister said Son was so determined to make himself a success in Europe that he learned
                    German
                    by watching episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants.

                <div class="sub-title">
                    Hamburger SV
                </div>

                <div class="body-text">
                    In August 2008, Son dropped out of Dongbuk High School's football club (formerly FC Seoul under-18 team)[25] and joined Hamburger SV's youth academy at age 16 through Korean FA Youth Project.[26][27] A year later, he returned to South Korea. After participating in the FIFA U-17 World Cup, he formally joined Hamburger SV's youth academy in November 2009[28]

                    He was impressive in the 2010–11 pre-season, leading the team with nine goals, and signed his first professional contract on his 18th birthday.[29] After scoring against Chelsea in August, he was out for two months due to a foot injury. He returned on 30 October 2010 to score his first league goal, against 1. FC Köln in the 24th minute. The goal made Son the youngest Hamburg player to score a goal in the Bundesliga at 18, breaking the record held by Manfred Kaltz.[30][31]

                    Son signed a new deal with Hamburg through 2014. Pundits said he had what it took to become the next Cha Bum-kun, a legendary Bundesliga forward and fellow South Korean.[32] Son scored three goals in 14 matches in all competition during the 2010–11 season.[33]

                    During the 2011–12 pre-season, Son was explosive, scoring 18 times in only nine matches.[34][35][36] After missing the opening match due to a fever, Son scored two goals within three matches.[37] On 27 August, Son picked up an ankle injury in the 4–3 loss to 1. FC Köln and was initially projected to be out of action for four to six weeks.[38] His recovery was quicker than expected and he returned to action only three weeks later as a substitute in a 1–0 loss against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 17 September. Over the course of the 2011–12 season, he made 30 appearances for Hamburg and scored five goals,[39] including crucial goals against Hannover 96 and 1. FC Nürnberg at the end of the season to help ensure that Hamburg remained in the Bundesliga.[40]

                    Following Hamburger SV's 2012–13 offseason moves, which saw the transfers of the team's strikers Mladen Petrić and Paolo Guerrero to Fulham and Corinthians respectively, manager Thorsten Fink chose to name Son a starter. The 2012–13 season was a breakthrough season for Son as he scored two goals in an away fixture against Borussia Dortmund on 9 February 2013, helping his team to a 4–1 victory. Son was chosen Mann des Tages (Man of the Match) by kicker.[41] On 14 April, Son netted two goals in a 2–1 win against Mainz 05. He finished the season with 12 goals, becoming the fifth South Korean footballer to achieve double digits in goals in Europe.[42] He finished the 2012–13 season with 12 goals in 34 matches in all competitions.[43]

                <div class = "body-text">
                    On 13 June 2013, Bayer Leverkusen confirmed Son's transfer for reportedly €10 million, which was the highest transfer fee in the club's history at the time. He agreed to a five-year deal with the team.[44] Son adjusted quickly to his new club in the pre-season, scoring three goals in his first three appearances for the team in exhibition matches (against 1860 Munich, Udinese and KAS Eupen respectively).[45]

                    On 9 November 2013, Son scored a hat-trick for Leverkusen in a 5–3 win against his former club Hamburgers SV.[46] On 7 December, Son scored a crucial goal against Borussia Dortmund to put his club just four points off the summit of the Bundesliga. On 10 May 2014, Son scored another goal against Werder Bremen ensuring his team a spot for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League.[47] He finished the 2013–14 season with 12 goals in 43 matches.[48]

                    Son scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg on 14 February 2015, in a 4–5 defeat, scoring when they were losing 0–3.[49] He finished the 2014–15 season with 17 goals in 42 matches.[50]


                    Son started the 2015–16 season with Bayer Leverkusen. He made a league appearance[51] and a Champions League qualifying match.[52]

                <div class = "body-text">
                    On 28 August 2015, Son joined Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for £22 million (€30 million) on a five-year contract, subject to work permit and international clearance.[53][54] Upon his signing, he became the most expensive Asian player in football history.[8] The record had been held since 2001 by Japanese Hidetoshi Nakata, who transferred from Roma to Parma for €25 million.[55]

                    Son made his debut on 13 September away to Sunderland, being replaced by Andros Townsend in the 62nd minute of a 1–0 win.[56] In Tottenham's first match of the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League on 17 September, Son netted his first two goals for the club in a 3–1 win against Qarabağ FK.[57] Three days later, he scored his first Premier League goal, against Crystal Palace at White Hart Lane, netting in the 68th minute to give Tottenham their first home Premier League win of the season.[58] On 28 December in the match against Watford, Son replaced Tom Carroll in the 80th minute and scored Tottenham's winning goal in the 89th minute.[59] On 2 May, he scored the second goal against Chelsea in a crucial match to give Spurs hope of winning the Premier League. Chelsea equalised in the second half, however, handing over the title to Leicester City.[60]

                2014 World Cup

            </div>

            <div class = "body-text">
                On 7 October 2011, after initially missing the first two matches of South Korea's 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign on 2 and 6 September 2011 due to an ankle injury, Son played in a friendly against Poland, and was again featured in 11 October World Cup qualifier against the United Arab Emirates.[134][135] His selection for national team play was a point of concern for Son's father, however, who caused a stir by asking the Korea Football Association not to select his son for the national team in the immediate future so he can rest and mature more as a player. Cho Kwang-rae, then the South Korea head coach, responded by saying that he would continue to call up Son when needed.[136]

                Son turned down the opportunity to participate in the 2012 London Olympics, opting to concentrate on his club career at Hamburger SV. Son was quoted as saying, "In Korea, an Olympic appearance has a special meaning, but I want to speed up for Hamburg. What matters is to pour all my time into team training."[137] Son did, however, play for the national team in the autumn of 2012 for two 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Lebanon and Iran,[138] and became a regular call-up in friendlies and World Cup qualifying matches in 2013. In the World Cup qualifier against Qatar on 23 March 2013, Son came on as a substitute in the 81st minute and scored the winning goal in the 96th minute.[139]

                In June 2014, Son was named in South Korea's squad for the 2014 World Cup.[140] On 22 June, he scored in a 4–2 defeat to Algeria in the team's second group match.[141] The Korea Football Association requested Bayer Leverkusen to allow Son to play in the 2014 Asian Games, as winning the gold medal at the tournament would grant Son exemption from military service. Despite Son affirming his interest and the KFA's efforts, his club at the time, Bayer Leverkusen, refused to release him, as his absence would mean the team would lose him for at least six matches.[142]
