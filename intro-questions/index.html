    1. I am Minju Kim, a junior majoring in communication design.
<p>2. As a student who is majoring in BA communication design, this course
    was one of the requirements, and I have also been interested in how design
    and computer work can interact to each other and bring the most work out of them.
</p>
<p>3. I do not have any experience with any of the languages listed.</p>
<p>4. I hope to learn how to build a viewer-centered webpage design.</p>
<p>5. I wish it becomes more flexible to edit and expand my ideas depending on
    different screen sizes.
</p>
<p>6. <a href = "https://athleticsnyc.com/"> Athletics.com</a> provides an effective design in its website because
    it interacts with the user's scrolling by showing different scenes through each scroll. They also play with colors
    and motion effects that engages the viewers while they view through the webpage.
</p>
<p>7.  <a href = "https://foundations2022fall.wudesign.me/assignments.php">Interaction Foundation course website</a> I believe our course webpage is a very effective website because it helps the viewer to navigate easier through
    categorizations and multiple vertical sections that includes essential informations for this course.</p>
<p>8. <a href = "https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html">McDonald's</a> website works well overall in its purpose to effectively
convey only essential informations needed to the webpage users. It uses minimum amount of color scheme that represents its brand, and
it is overall very easy to navigate especially through their photo use.</p>
